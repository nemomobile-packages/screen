Description: |
    The screen utility allows you to have multiple logins on just one
    terminal. Screen is useful for users who telnet into a machine or are
    connected via a dumb terminal, but want to use more than just one
    login.
    
    Install the screen package if you need a screen manager that can
    support multiple logins on one terminal.
